### General Notes
___

- There are four work packages that the client wants us to do over this semester, each will be defined and explained during the next client meeting.
- Our team is made up of a mix of different technical backgrounds and experience, so we should ahve a good coverage over both the frontend and backend of the platform.
- Previous semesters for this project had one semester do a lot of coding, and the next semester do a lot of research, so our client is trying to balance that for this semester (work package 3 has some research tasks to do).
