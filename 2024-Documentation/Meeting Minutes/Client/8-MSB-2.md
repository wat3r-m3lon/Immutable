### Agenda
___

1. Status of WP2 and projections for timeline
2. GitHub Project
3. CI/CD in GitHub
4. Brief on WP3 (for planning)
5. Final Notes

### Synopsis
___

- Previous Teams have not used any CI/CD to measures to confidently verify there codebase is of a level of software quality, Quin is neither opposed nor pushing the team to implementing a CI/CD pipeline.
- The first part of WP3 is a research task into decentralized hosting (see general notes).
- Quin will follow up with the admin for our projects repo to create a new project for our git issues.

### Feedback
___

- Quin is satisfied with seeing demos of our features during client meetings as another way of verifying our code base is functional and features are being delivered.

### Decisions
___

- The first part of WP3 can be done by Mitchell 
  - start once the Documentation Overhaul is finished 
  - while the rest of the team continue working on WP2
- The team did not see any reason for WP2 to have its deadline extended (still due 1st of May).
- CI/CD pipeline will be explored after Documentation Overhaul by Mitchell, this will be kept separate from the rest of the dev team to ensure work packages are still completed on time.
- The team will try to have some complete modules of code relating to WP2 to demo to client for next week.

### General Notes
___

- Look at hosting the platform decentralized
- create a research report, Identify 8 different decentralized options for hosting, decide on the top 4 or 3 go into more depth for the pros and cons, replication
  - when going in depth, what the differentiating factors that distinguish this from the others.
  - Strictly on decentralized options.
- Increase platform security, 
- Client will pick on of the 4 options and we will try and implement it in code
- The best option might not be viable to do this semester (especially if there are costs that need to be promoted to directors)
-
