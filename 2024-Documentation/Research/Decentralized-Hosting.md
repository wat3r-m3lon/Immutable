## Decentralized Hosting ##
___

Decentralised hosting is a method of hosting a platform or website on the web using an IPFS network and an Ethereum smart contracts to manage the IPFS network and the web hosting service. The IPFS network is used to store data and to host the website, storing data to IPFS permanently is done through a **IPFS Pinning Service**. <br>

For more information on what decentralized hosting is and how it works, here is an online [research report](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Decentralized-Solution-for-Web-Hosting-Huynh-Nguyen/6493e364742d63fc55547cbbea1100804e86887f) for clarification.

## The Need ##
___

Decentralized hosting has the many advantages when compared to hosting 'Web2.0', theses include:
- **Long-term Cost Savings**: IPFS pinning can save a significant amount of money long term when storing large amounts of data on decentralized storage platforms, the cost per gigabyte of storage can be lower than traditional methods
- **Security and Privacy**: IPFS networks often have encryption and access control methods as core features of the storage, so data security and privacy is usually improved
- **Durability and Reliability**: each piece of data stored on an IPFS is replicated over multiple nodes through a peer-to-peer system which can span over multiple countries. This makes it virtually impossible for the platforms data-sets to be completely lost and minimises any down-time due to server maintenance.

## Selection Criteria ##
___

The service below are being evaluated on the following criteria:
- **Competitive Pricing**: Pricing plans are competitive with comparison to other IPFS pinning services, for the features and services the platform provides.
- **Cloud Storage of IPFS Network (Pinning)**: The service can pin (upload and permanently store) to a IPFS network
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: Required for queries order (connect, search, authenticate)
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Decides the float number of customers of a zone using the platform
- **Reliable Reputation for Hosting**: The service is trusted by other sites and platforms
- **Actively Maintained (not Deprecated)**: The service is actively being maintained
- **Wide Service Range**: The service hosts IPFS networks in a wide range of nations, must have the ability to host with Australia
- **Up-to-date Documentation Support**: There is documentation such as how-to and technical documents relating to the service

### 3rd - [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) ###

Fleek pricing plans include a free option for IPFS, This is valuable for the initial testing of the Immutable platform.

However, Fleek also has far more metrics that are paid for. There is a cost of $15/User/Month for extra users, as well as costs associated with build times (see the pricing page for all metrics [here](https://fleek.co/pricing/))

Setting up IPFS hosting through Fleek is done through a projects GitHub which streamlines the deployment of new features.

### 4th - [Kaleido](https://www.kaleido.io/blockchain-as-a-service) ###

There does not appear to be a direct way of configuring the DNS of a site stored and deployed through Kaleido.io. The service instead allows you to set an end-point to an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Kaleido.io charges per-hour rather than per-month, the pricing plans listed below only consider the price of using an Etherium node, there are additional costs for storage not included in those prices (see full pricing breakdown [here](https://www.kaleido.io/pricing#pricing-details)). This results in most use cases being very expensive compared to other options.

**Pricing Plans** - $0/Month or $109.50/Month or $401.50/Month (pricing plans can be found [here](https://www.kaleido.io/pricing#pricing-details))  <br>
**IPFS Cloud Storage** - Yes (user manual for setting up can be found [here](https://docs.kaleido.io/kaleido-services/ipfs/)) <br>

**Documentation** - Full User Manual (can be found [here](https://docs.kaleido.io/)) <br>

## Other Options ##
___

4 additional options for decentralized hosting, in no particular order.

There also exists 3rd party sites such as [SlashDot](https://slashdot.org/software/ipfs-pinning/?sort=rating_avg) and [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/software/ipfs-pinning/australia/), which find and rank decentralized hosting services and provide some basic details about each service. 


### [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) ###

- Filebase imposes hard service limits for there API rather than charging extra costs for exceeding price plans. 
  This caps the amount of requests per second to 100, which is bad for scalability.
- There does not appear to be any in-service method of configuring the DNS of the site.  

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.filebase.com/). <br>
Pricing plans can be found [here](https://filebase.com/pricing/).

### [Flux](https://runonflux.io/) ###

- Referenced in previous semesters research report as a possible option for web3.0 hosting.
- Issues presented by the previous semesters research report still seem to be true.
- Storage costs are very expensive compared to all other options listed above. 

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.runonflux.io/). <br>
Pricing plans can be found [here](https://cloud.runonflux.io/#/plans).

### [Eternum](https://www.eternum.io/) ###

- Not much documentation or user guide available for setting up the service
- A cheap initial cost of storage, but will become more expensive than other options as storage demand increases.
- No information on the amount of requests or bandwidth the service can handle, seems to be aimed at very small / personal sites
- There does not appear to be any in-service method of configuring the DNS of the site.

The only pricing metric appear to be $0.30/GB, found on there homepage [here](https://www.eternum.io/)

### [infura](https://www.infura.io/) ### 

- Storage costs are packaged separately and are more expensive compared to other options listed above.
- There does not appear to be any in-service method of configuring the DNS of the site. can only change the sub domain of the site (see [here](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/ipfs/how-to/access-ipfs-content/dedicated-gateways))

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/ipfs). <br>
Pricing plans can be found [here](https://www.infura.io/pricing).

## Conclusion ##
___

For the initial deployment of the Immutable platform it is **recommended to use Pinata**. The service is fulfills all selection criteria and has a free option with enough storage, bandwidth, and requests for testing. 

QuickNode is also a good long term option and would usually be rated first. However, not being able to deploy an IPFS network through the free account of QuickNode makes it less desirable of an option compared to Pinata during the initial deployment phase of the Immutable platform.
