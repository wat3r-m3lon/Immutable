# NFT2.0 - Immutable and Non-transferable Qualifications

_What if your degree/qualification/competency was issued to you as an NFT, held in your public wallet, easily verified by employers, never lost, and retained by you in perpetuity?_ 

## Background
Public blockchain technology and NFTs have exploded over the last few years as a means for speculative investors to make it big or get REKT. While finance and digital art have found a place leveraging the early adoption of blockchain due to the immutability, security, transparency, and speed of a distributed ledger, they are not the only sectors who can benefit from these characteristics. Industries who will adopt and benefit from blockchain are those which rely on transparency, verification, or a trusted intermediary to support their outcomes – Education is a perfect example of one of these sectors.

Consider the purpose of your degree – it provides public proof (transparency), from a registered organisation (verification), that you have obtained the required qualification for a certain type of job. You then go to the job market and provide an employer your qualification (you are the intermediary), however for the employer you are not a trusted intermediary; this get worse over time or if the degree was issued in another country. Reconsider the opening statement – can having your qualification on the blockchain support the outcomes of both you and the employer?

## The Project
So where does this project fit in the blockchain landscape?
There are a few issues that need to be tackled when considering qualifications on the blockchain:
Non-transferability – NFTs are but their nature transferrable, great for art and assets, not great for a qualification that you earnt and can’t just give or sell to someone else.
Suitability and Scalability – Which blockchain or blockchains can support this type of NFT and support the scale of information being minted, stored and accessed over the next 50 years.
Multichain Interoperability – Developing for interoperability across various blockchains will support long-term viability, scalability and adoption.
Adoption – While the number of people involved in blockchain, crypto and public wallets is steadily increasing, adoption of blockchain backed qualifications will require additional on ramps for students and institutions.

**Previous Semester**
- In 2022 semester 2, the ANU TechLauncher team did research and analysis to determine the feasibility of the project. They engaged in a Market scan and positioning analysis, requirements development, analysis of layer 1 public blockchains and data architecture. After the analysis was completed, The Techlauncher then created a Proof-of-Concept (POC) for the various layers of the platform.
- In 2023 semester 1, the team offered the MVP1.0, documentation and support for developers. Based on the MVP delivered in semester 1 2023, we aim to refine and improve this MVP by enhancing its stability, scalability, security and compatibility which consists of XX stories in the User Story Map for this semester.
- In 2023 semester 2, the team conducted thorough research and produced detailed reports on web hosting, permissioned blockchain networks, and compliance with digital consortium data process standards. They successfully deployed the NFT2.0 website, finalized a detailed system architecture document, and released Immutable MVP v2.0, which complied with the Digital Consortium Database Schema and included significant bug fixes and UI/UX enhancements.




**This semester**  
-   In this semester, the team will be working on refining the MVP2.0 from four aspects: stability, scalability, security and compatibility.
  
1.Microcredential Framework Compliance: Ensure the NFT 2.0 platform aligns with the National Microcredential Framework by integrating all necessary metadata and adhering to the Department of Education’s Qualification Framework.

2.Application Process Uplift: Automate the institution verification process to facilitate real-time approvals of user NFT requests, thereby enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of the NFT 2.0 administration.

3.Decentralised Hosting: Identify and implement a suitable decentralized hosting solution from top candidates to ensure the NFT 2.0 platform is robust, secure, and capable of operating on a global scale.

4.Project Maintenance: Continuously improve the NFT 2.0 platform's UI/UX for better user experience while maintaining system integrity through regular bug fixes and updates to the Systems Architecture Document (SAD).
